DialScript dialog file example
==============================

This is an experimental dialog scripting format, so don't expect it
to be stable and finalized.

"[Scene.x]" Defines the start of a scene block. Scenes are top-level
containers for dialog and metadata.
Instead of "x", we need to use a unique number for each scene in the
file.
    [Scene.1]

"Level: x" is a key-value pair that specifies the level of the scene.
    Level: 1

"Location: x" defines the location. Usually just a string, but could
be a number (e.g. an ID).
    Location: Forest

"Characters: x" lists the characters present in the scene. This is a
comma-separated list of character names.
    Characters: Alan, Beth

"Main dialog" here is a comment. Comments start with "//" and can be
placed anywhere in the file. They must be ignored by the parser.
    // Main dialog

"[Dialog.x]" defines a dialog block. Each dialog block contains lines
spoken by characters. Instead of "x", we need to use a unique number
for each dialog block in the scene.
    [Dialog.1]

Each line in a dialog block starts with the character's name, followed
by a ": ", and then the dialog text. Lines must include at least one
character and some text.

Optionally, lines can include metadata in
curly braces "{}" at the end of the line. Metadata can specify emotions,
choices, or other information relevant to the dialog line.

    Alan: Lorem ipsum {Emotion: surprised}
    Beth: Lorem ipsum
    Beth: Lorem ipsum {Choices: 1, 2}
    Alan: Lorem ipsum {Choice: 1}
    Beth: Lorem ipsum {Choice 2}, {Emotion: happy}

Additional dialog blocks can be defined similarly with the same
number as in the previous example.

If we want another dialog block, we can define it with a new number.
Check the example below.
    // Additional dialog
    [Dialog.1]
    Beth: Lorem ipsum

    // Second additional dialog
    [Dialog.1]
    Beth: Lorem ipsum
    Alan: Lorem ipsum

Here is an example of a new dialog after a condition (?) is met.
    // Activated condition, new dialog block
    [Dialog.2]
    Alan: Lorem ipsum
    Alan: Lorem ipsum {Emotion: thinking}
    Alan: Lorem ipsum
